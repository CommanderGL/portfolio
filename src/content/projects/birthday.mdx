When I originally created *<ContentLink href={frontmatter.website}>Birthday Website Generator!</ContentLink>* it was for my Mom's birthday. When deciding the framework I decided to try out *[Vue](https://vuejs.org/)*. I slowly fell in love with *Vue* and all of it's features. The way *Vue* handled state was so much better than other frameworks like *[React](https://react.dev/)*. My love of *Vue* eventually led me to start a *[OpenYT](https://github.com/OpenSourceYT/OpenYT)* (an open-source YouTube Client.)

I plan to enhance this project by turning it in to a *Celebration Website Generator*. The *Celebration Website Generator* will have several holday theme options (like Christmas, Easter, Hallowean, or Valentines Day) and a custom option where users can design their own celebration theme with custom emojis, colors, and messages! I also plan to add a few more minor changes like adding support for pages without a name and share URLs for custom themes.
