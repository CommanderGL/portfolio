I originally created *<ContentLink href={frontmatter.website}>Birthday Website Generator!</ContentLink>* for my Mom's birthday. I had decided to try out a new framework *[(Vue)](https://vuejs.org/)* with this new project. I slowly fell in love with *Vue* and all of it's features. The *Vue* Community also seemed to be very quite nice. My love of *Vue* quickly led me to start a new project [(OpenYT)](https://github.com/OpenSourceYT/OpenYT) with it.

I plan to enhance this project by turning it in to a *Celebration Website Generator*. The *Celebration Website Generator* will have several holday theme options (like Christmas, Easter, Hallowean, or Valentines Day) and a custom option where users can design their own celebration theme with custom emojis, colors, and messages! I also plan to add a few more minor changes like adding support for pages without a name and share URLs for custom themes.
